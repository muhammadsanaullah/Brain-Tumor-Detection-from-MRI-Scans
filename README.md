# Tumor Detection & Extraction from MRI Scans of the Human Brain
Medical imaging analysis provides a very informative and comprehensive insight into diagnosing diseases and in treating health problems.
The aim of this project was to offer a means of detecting and extracting tumors from given MRI scans of the human brain. 
The method involves taking an MRI image of the brain, run it through a number of filtering and analytical processes to determine whether 
a tumor exists or not, identify and extract it thereof. Tumors are normally seen as distinct white areas in MRI scans. 
The program will aim to locate and isolate such a tumor by filtering the image and ridding it of noise, then use segmentation and 
structuring techniques to outline and differentiate it from the rest of the brain, particularly other white areas such as spaces 
between gyri or the skull etc. All these processes are performed in MATLAB.

The project aims to provide great insight into MRI Imaging Analysis and Brain Tumor diagnosis, which can help benefit physicians and
patients, and other relevant parties, in the fields of medicinal and health sciences, as well as imaging and signal analysis.
